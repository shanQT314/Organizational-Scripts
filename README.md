#  Scripts

## Life organization scripts 

And by life organization, I mean letting me see what I do with my life, by organizing all the data that I have and accumulate over time on various devices and stuff. It's mostly based on a post I wrote on my blog, where I realized there's so much data about me everywhere, that it might be a good idea to centralize it and I suppose give it to me in reports? Not sure. 

So the first step was to get the sleeping data, which I did in sleepGet.py, so next steps? 

<ol>
<li> How to have it running in the background on my raspberry pi and be automated and have it run everyday at a certain time? </li>
<li> Figure out how to use the Google Calendar API to connect it and make it direct</li>
<li> Figure out the json file for the location history on google maps </li>
<li> Figure out the rescueTime API and start getting time booked off using that and afformentioned google calendar API </li>
<li> Trying to find out how I can get banking information to add weekly expenses to my database of life information </li>
<li> Maybe see if I can get spotify API to see when I use my study playlist </li>
<li> Connecting them all and putting it all in some form of weekly report via email or HTML website or something </li>
</ol>
